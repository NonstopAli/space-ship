Final Project: Space Ship 
Description:
Space Ship is a 2D space shooter game where the player controls a spaceship to defend Earth from waves of incoming aliens.
The player can move left and right, shoot bullets, and try to destroy all enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen.
The game ends when the aliens reach the bottom — or when the player wins by eliminating them all.
The project was inspired by the Alien Invasion example from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, but I redesigned and customized many parts of the code (classes, structure, and features) to make it my own version.
Technologies Used:
Python 3
Pygame library
How to Run:
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Install Pygame by running: pip install pygame 
Run the game using: python3 space_ship.py 
Files:
space_ship.py — Main file that runs the game
settings.py — Stores game configuration
ship.py — Handles spaceship movement and rendering
bullet.py — Manages bullet creation and updates
alien.py — Defines alien behavior
game_stats.py — Tracks score and game state
Features:
Smooth spaceship movement
Shooting mechanics with bullets
Alien fleet movement
Scoring system
Game Over and Win screens
Acknowledgments:
This project was inspired by Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, but all redesigns, improvements, and new gameplay logic were written by me.
